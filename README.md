# United States census data - income level prediction

This repository contains a notebook and a Streamlit app to present the analysis of a dataset from the United States Census Bureau, in order to predict wether a person is making more or less than $50,000 per year.  
The studied dataset contains demographic and economic information about ~300,000 individuals.  

The notebook and the app are following the same steps:

- The notebook is useful for an explanation of the whole process, step by step,  
- The app is more suited for an interactive presentation.

## Usage  

Install the necessary packages in your environment: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Notebook  

Run all the cells of `us_census_analysis.ipynb` to be able to use the interactive plots. The whole run should take around 2 to 5 minutes.  

### Streamlit app  

Type `streamlit run app/Home.py` in a terminal in the root directory of the repository, then navigate the app in your browser.
